            <p> Pyrros Dimas is a retired weightlifter who represented the country of Greece internationally. He is largely considered one of the greatest weightlifters
                ever due to his dominant performances over the years. Pyrros Dimas has won many medals on the international stage, including 3 gold medals at the Olympics,
                3 gold medals at world championships, and several other silver and bronze medals. He is the most decorated Greek athlete in history, and the most decorated weightlifter
                of all time. Since his retirement, Dimas has ventured into Greek politics and is now involved in Weightlifting bureaucracy.

            <p> 
                Pyrros Dimas was born in Himara, Albania in 1971. His parents were both ethnically Greek. He discovered weightlifting at the age of 11 by happenstance. On this particular day,
                Pyrros' future weightlifting coach, Zef Kovaci, saw him climb a tree to grab some fruit. When Pyrros realized he had been seen, he ran away and Kovaci pursued him.
                When Kovaci finally caught up, he asked if Dimas would be interested in doing weightlifting. As a child, Dimas' natural strength and athleticism impressed his mentors and peers. He began
                to compete at the age of 14 and by the age of 18 had won championships in Albania multiple times.

                In May of 1990, Dimas ranked 4th at the European Weightlifting Championship in Aalborg, Denmark. During his stay, Dimas was approached by representatives from Greece interested
                in recruiting him for the national team. The political situation in the People's Socialist Republic of Albania made it difficult for Dimas to leave to Greece until 1991, when he
                was able to cross the border and move to Athens. After being granted citizenship in 1992, he competed for Greece in the Olympics and won the gold medal in his weightclass.
                Prior to Dimas' victory, it had been 90 years since a Greek athlete had won Olympic gold in weightlifting, and 12 years since a Greek athlete had won Olympic gold in any sport.
                Pyrros Dimas went on to win several other world championships and Olympic games before earning his final medal -- a bronze at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Greece -- and retiring 
                (signified by a weightlifter leaving their shoes on the platform after their final attempt).
