# web-design-projects

This repository is the home for my first few web design projects. These projects are being done to complete the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web-Design certification.

"dimas-tribute" contains HTML and CSS for a tribute page to one of my favorite athletes. I used this project as a means of practicing structure & organization for basic web pages, and to experiment with aesthetic aspects of the page.
